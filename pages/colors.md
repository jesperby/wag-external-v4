Our web site and our web applications have a clear and distinct color scheme mostly in gray scale that gives focus to the content and the applications and makes it easy for the user to perform her tasks. Colors used the Global Assets are defined in the [Sass variables file]({{ site.baseurl}}/sass_utilities). You can use it in your own application, or have it as a refernce if you don't use Sass.

Other colors are available in the [branding guidelines](http://www.malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Sa-arbetar-vi-med.../Kommunikationsfragor/Grafisk-manual.html).
